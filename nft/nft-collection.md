### Frequently Asked Questions

- **Why can't I get the ID value from my address**
   - Answer: It is possible that your NFT contract does not have a function to query ID by address (for example, these functions do not exist: `tokensOfOwner(address)`, `walletOfOwner(address)`, `getOwnerTokens(address)`), which will not be possible. If the ID is found, it is also possible that there is no NFT in the current address.

- **Do I need to retain mining fees for batch collection of NFT small addresses**
   - Answer: Yes, batch collection is the same as transferring funds through your wallet. The tool only replaces your transfer operation. In the end, the address initiates the transfer, so gas and mining fees are required. In order to avoid failure, try to reserve as much mining fees as possible.
