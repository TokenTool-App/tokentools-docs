- **Can I set the tax separately for buying and selling differently? For example (buying marketing: 1%, selling marketing: 2%)? **
   - Answer: No, this version **`Business`** and **`Transfer`** are the same and cannot be disassembled. If you need to set differently, you can use other versions such as (V2, V3, version issued currency)
- **Why is there no swap platform to choose in this version? **
