### Mechanism Description

```
The distribution of tax rates mainly includes:
Marketing, reflow, destruction, adding pool dividends

Marketing : Tokens are deducted, exchanged for pot coins at 'trigger' -> into the marketing wallet
Return : Tokens are deducted, and the pool is automatically added when it is triggered -> this part of the administrator address can be withdrawn from the pool
Destruction: Tokens are deducted and sent directly to the black hole for destruction
Adding pool dividends: Deduct tokens, 'when triggered' exchange dividend coins for pool adding users
```

1. The MateMask wallet is linked to the blockchain network.
2. Open the create token link address [https://tokentools.app/createToken/v4](https://tokentools.app/createToken/v4)
3. Enter the necessary information, but before that, let's review all the important fields that need to be filled:

**Currency name:** The name information of the token (such as BitCoin)

**Currency symbol:** The symbol information of the token (such as BTC)

**Initial Supply:** The total supply of tokens

**Accuracy:** The number of digits of precision of the token (the precision is the number of decimal places representing the currency `for example: 0.000001` means that there are 6 digits of precision)

**Blacklist:** The blacklist restricts buying and selling switch (after it is turned on, it can be operated on the administrator page to add certain addresses that cannot be used for `transaction`, `transfer`)

**Trading platform:** Different chains will have different trading platforms (such as `uniswap` for the ETH chain, `pancakeSwap` for the BSC chain, etc.), **After the token is created, liquidity needs to be added to the corresponding trading platform . **

**Custom trading pair:** By default, BNB trading pair is used to create tokens. By customizing the trading pair switch, you can enter USDT, BUSD and other contract addresses to combine trading pair information

**Add pool dividend contract:** The address reward contract for adding pool can use mainstream currencies such as `USDT`, `DOGE`, `SHIB`, or you can use local currency dividends.


**Marketing Wallet:** The tokens of `Marketing Tax` will be converted into pot currency `BNB` or `USDT` (depending on your pool trading pair) and sent to this address.

**Liquidity (%):** Each transaction will deduct the corresponding proportion of tokens and send them to the `contract address`, and the pool will be automatically added when the **trigger mechanism** is activated to make the pool thicker.

**Marketing (%):** Each transaction will deduct a corresponding proportion of tokens and send them to the `contract address`, which will be automatically converted into pot coins when **triggers the mechanism** (depending on what pot you use, What currency does marketing) send to your marketing wallet address

**Dividend (%):** Each transaction will deduct the corresponding proportion of tokens and send them to the `contract address`, which will be automatically converted into `USDT` when **triggers the mechanism** (depending on the dividend token you choose) Issued to the address of the user who added the pool

**Destroy (%):** In each transaction, the base token will be destroyed according to the proportional amount, and transferred to `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead` black hole address




## Token administrator introduction

When the current owner (owner) has not given up the authority, he can enter the background through the token administrator page to visually modify its parameters and other information. We provide a friendly interactive page to make it easier for managers to operate contracts/modify parameters.

3. **Contract address: ** Display the current token contract address
4. **Ownership transfer:** The owner authority can be transferred to a third party or other address in the future
5. **Destroy authority:** Transfer owner address to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` address

10. **Address fission:** Each transaction will automatically airdrop `little bit` tokens to a random address to achieve the effect of increasing the currency holding address

- **What is the concept of the dividend pool mentioned in the above description? **
