# Adding/Removing Whitelists

The whitelist on TokenTool is a list of approved addresses by the administrator, and only these addresses can participate in the presale. The purpose of having a whitelist is to protect the presale from bot attacks and to have genuine investors. You can enable/disable the whitelist feature at any time before the presale begins or while creating a Launchpad, as described in [Creating Launchpad](https://docs.tokentools.app/launchpads/create-a-launchpad).



## Start whitelist




When creating the launchpad, in Step 2 - DeFi Launchpad Information, you can choose to enable/disable the whitelist by clicking Disable or Enable in the Whitelist section:

When submitting your launchpad, you can see "Sell via: Private Mode".

![add-remove-whitelists](../.gitbook/assets/launchpad/Snipaste_2022-05-08_14-56-51.png)



If you forgot to enable the whitelist when creating your launchpad, you can also update the launchpad by clicking the " Private Sale" button to enable it.

MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee you need to pay for the transaction. If you agree, click the "Confirm" button to complete the process.



## disable whitelist

If you wish to disable the whitelist, you can do so by clicking "Disable Whitelist" in the owner area of the launchpad.

![add-remove-whitelists](../.gitbook/assets/launchpad/Snipaste_2022-05-08_15-03-14.png)

MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee you need to pay for the transaction. If you agree, click the "Confirm" button to complete the process.

NOTE: You can "disable whitelist" during a presale to turn the sale into a public sale instead of a whitelisted presale.



## How to add whitelist

You can add the wallet addresses of pre-sale participants at any time before or even during the pre-sale. You can do this by clicking "Add user to whitelist" in the owner area of the launchpad.

![add-remove-whitelists](../.gitbook/assets/launchpad/Snipaste_2022-05-08_15-03-41.png)


After clicking "Add User to Whitelist", you will see a popup box. Here you can add addresses to the whitelist. Addresses are wrapped in newlines (one address per line), without commas, the following list can be used as an example:

0x34E7f6A4d0BB1fa7aFe548582c47Df337FC337E6

0xd8Ebc66f0E3D638156D6F5eFAe9f43B1eBc113B1

0x968136BB860D9534aF1563a7c7BdDa02B1A979C2

![add-remove-whitelists](../.gitbook/assets/launchpad/Snipaste_2022-05-08_15-04-02.png)



Click "Add User" after entering the address, MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee you need to pay for the transaction. If you agree, click the "Confirm" button to complete the process.

Note: You can add up to 400 addresses to your whitelist at a time.



## How to delete the whitelist

You can remove the wallet addresses of presale participants by clicking "Add user to whitelist" in the owner area of the launchpad.

![add-remove-whitelists](../.gitbook/assets/launchpad/Snipaste_2022-05-08_15-07-20.png)

0xd8Ebc66f0E3D638156D6F5eFAe9f43B1eBc113B1
