https://www.tokentools.app is a free collection of tools on the blockchain, today I will teach you how to quickly snap up the pre-sale tokens on DxSale. DxSale is not going to introduce much here. If you still donâ€™t know what DxSale is for, you can go online to learn first.

The pre-sale currently only supports projects on the BSC chain of the DX platform, and projects on other chains will be added in the future. This tutorial uses the BSC-test network demo.
The price of the pre-sale is the Gwei fee. The higher the gwei, the faster you can grab it. If you have a very fancy golden dog, please do not be stingy with the gwei.

To grab the pre-sale, you need to get the address of the project on the dx platform, which is usually in the link. For this demonstration, I randomly found one on the BSC-test network to check whether the information is correct.

Check in advance to confirm whether the pre-sale information is correct, as well as the minimum/maximum purchase amount. If there is a very fancy golden dog, the rush-purchase speed can be doubled.

In order to prevent panic buying failure, you can enable the failure retry mechanism. The failure retry mechanism will place orders in an infinite loop (gas fee will be burned). If it fails, you need to check the failure situation or the status of the project party group through the blockchain browser urgently. Whether the deposit is the reason for the failure of information such as deposit.

Start the rush purchase. If the pre-sale time is not up, the program will enter the countdown state. When the time is up, the order will be automatically placed and snapped up. Demonstration here, I will find another project that has already started pre-sale to demonstrate. As shown below

The snap-up is successful. With the snap-up pre-sale scientist, everyone can hang up on the computer a few minutes in advance to automatically place an order. There is no need to operate through the little fox, which greatly improves the speed of snapping up. This tutorial ends everywhere.
