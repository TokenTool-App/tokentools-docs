##### Gwei gas fee

So first make sure you have enough BNB to cover the transaction gas fees on the chain. Usually the gs fee will fluctuate according to the packaged transaction queue on the chain. If there are many transactions, a higher gas fee may be required to push the transaction. Learn more about [Gwei gas fees](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/gas) here

##### Slippage settings

It is not uncommon for tokens on the **BNB smart chain to include transaction fees** in their contracts, usually these fees can be used for burning, or entering the marketing wallet address of the project party.
Slippage will be the tolerance for the amount received in a transaction, how much tokens we can accept to lose, for example, 1USDT is converted into 0.996378....BUSD in the figure, such as the slippage setting %**50%** . It means that this transaction can tolerate the loss of **50%** tokens. If it is set to 1%, when the transaction occurs, if the number of tokens lost is greater than 1%, it will prompt the miner to roll back this time Transaction exchange operation.

##### receiving address

You can set a fixed receiving address during the transaction exchange, and the tokens of token1 can be automatically collected to the receiving address during the batch exchange, which can save secondary collection.

##### Trading Deadline

The tolerance time for transactions to be packaged on the chain, such as a sudden surge in Gwei gas fees, your transaction may have been in the padding state on the chain and cannot be successfully packaged.
