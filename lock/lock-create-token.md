# create ERC20 token lock

## What is a token lock?

Token Locking allows DeFi projects to set custom token locking parameters.

By using TokenToolLocks to lock team members' tokens and treasury, projects can instill trust in their communities and show they are engaged for the long term. Time-locked tokens cannot be released until the lock expires, so investors can be confident that the team won't dump all their tokens on the market (aka "exit scam").



## Why is token lock important?

**Projects can lock a percentage of the pre-mined token supply or team-owned tokens into our time-locked decentralized smart contract vault. **

Projects cannot access tokens until the lock-up period expires. In this way, the community and investors can rest assured that the tokens will not be dumped by the team during the contract period, the so-called exit scam.

This is a huge innovation compared to most token offerings, where projects may avoid fulfilling their promises and sell all their tokens in bad faith, leaving holders, stakers and investors The price of the tokens of the latter is close to $0.
